Very Opinionated FiveM React Boilerplate


#### NOTE: If you do not have FontAwesome Pro & your npm setup to install their pro packages you likely will not be able to use this without changing the package.json to use their free packages.

## Likely can find better options
This is being created solely for quick project creation for ARP as I'm sticking more to what I know than taking the time to learn newer/different tech such as Recoil or TypeScript.

As stated, this is a very opinionated boilerplate which is prepped for use of Redux, React Router, and Nui interaction which stores direct to Redux store.

All credit to the Nui interaction goes to [calumari](https://github.com/calumari/fivem-react-boilerplate). His boilerplate was a starting point where I just upgraded to Webpack 5, integrated React Router & Material-UI.
